# Working with Multiple GitHub Accounts on VS Code:
1. Open git bash and goto .ssh
cd ~/.ssh
2. Check if you already have an SSH key.
ls -al ~/.ssh
# it ends with .pub extention.
3. Generate a new SSH key.
# execute one by one
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "personal_email_address" -f ~/.ssh/<personal_github_username>
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "company_email_address" -f ~/.ssh/<company_github_username>
4. Start SSH-agent
eval `ssh-agent -s`
# Then you get an output similar toAgent pid 1576
6. Adding the public SSH key to GitHub.
# Open the .pub file on VScode or Vim and then copy the keys.
# execute one by one
code ~/.ssh/personal_github_username.pub
code ~/.ssh/company_github_username.pub
# Then goto Github → Settings → Keys or
# https://github.com/settings/keys and click on the New SSH key.
7. Create config file.
#execute one by one
touch config
code config           # to open this in VS code.
# Add the below content inside the config file.
#inside ~/.ssh/config
Host *
  IgnoreUnknown AddKeysToAgent,UseKeychain
  AddKeysToAgent yes
  UseKeychain yes
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/<personal_github_username> # Default key (You can also use company key)

# This is where all content will be tracked and stored.

# The 4 milestones are:
Step 1: Initailize Git for the project folder (this will create a local repository)
Step 2: Add a file to the folder and add this file for change tracking on Git
Step 3: Commit to changes locally
Step 4: Publish the changes to a remote/centralize repository (GitHub / AzureDevops for others to see your updats)
